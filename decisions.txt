For a JS Starter kit following decisions have to be considered

Editors and Configurations
Package Management
Development Webserver
Automation
Transpiling
Bundling
Linting
HTTP
Testing and CI
Project Structure
Production Build
Automated Deployment

For Integration: Git
For Deployment : Heroku


Module 1: Editor: What to look for
- Strong ES2015+ Support
- AutoCompletion
- Parse ES6 imports
- Report unused imports
- Automated refactoring
- Framework Intelligence
- Built-in terminal
- Recommended -- Atom, WebStorm, Brackets, VSCode

Module 2: Package Managers
- bower(irrelavant), npm(most recommended), jspm(also a bundler), jam, volo
- https://gist.github.com/coryhouse/29bd1029b623beb4c7f79b748dcba844
- package security -- retire.js, Node Security Platform
- npm now has security scanning built-in

Module 3: Development Web Servers
- http-server, live-server
    light weight, easily configurable, limited capabilities
- express
    comprehensive, highly configurable, production grade, can run it
    everywhere
    alternatives: koa, hapi
- budo
    integrates with browserify, hot reloading
- webpack
    fast, serves directly from memory
    avoids pulling another dependency
    it doesn't require generating physical files
- browsersync
    dedivated IP for sharing work on LAN
    all interactions remain same
    great for cross-device testing
    integrates with browserify, webpack, gulp
- all the ones mentioned above(except express) are only used for development
